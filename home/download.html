    <br /><br />
    <!--<img src="images/1.jpg" alt="神奇的图片"/><br /><br />-->

        I’m someone who LOVES to stay organized and keeping my schedule in order is a big part of
        that. Managing your schedule can definitely be difficult as a busy university student,
        but it’s also such an important skill to master. I’ve compiled a list of tips that I’ve
        found helpful for managing my time in my five (!) years as a UVic student.
    <br /><br />
        <strong style="color: cadetblue">1.Use a scheduling tool.</strong>
        <br /><br />
        I’m not particularly good at keeping track of anything in my head, so it’s important that it
        all gets written down. I prefer to maintain my schedule in a hard-copy planner; there is
        something about physically dividing up my time onpaper that really works for me. Plus, my
        paper planner won’t ever run out of battery!
        <br /><br />
        <strong style="color: cadetblue">2.Write down important deadlines on the first day of class.</strong>
        <br /><br />
        On the first day of class, students receive a syllabus, or course outline, which contains
        important dates and deadlines. As soon as I receive my syllabus, I transfer all of these dates
        into my planner, taking note of particularly busy periods and any potential conflicts. If I’m still “course shopping”,
        or finalizing which courses I’m going to take, timing may influence my decision.
        <br /><br />
        <strong style="color: cadetblue">3.Use colour.<br /><br /></strong>
        At the beginning of each term, I assign each class a certain colour of highlighter. After
        writing down important deadlines, I highlight each with the corresponding colour for that
        class. Highlighting makes those important dates really stand out, ensuring the deadline
        doesn’tcreep up on me and allows me to note key points in the term for each class.
        <br /><br />
    <strong style="color: cadetblue">4.Schedule all commitments.<br /><br /></strong>
    I use my planner to schedule all activities that I have each day, both for school and my
    life outside of school. I allot chunks of time for class, meetings, work, coffee with friends,
    or anything else that I may have planned. Even if the activity is routine (for example, I have
    class every Monday and Thursday at 10 a.m.), I still take note of it. This makes
    it very easy for me to see, at a glance, what my day looks like and when I have free time.
    <br /><br />
        Whew, I think that’s it! I’ll admit that I can be more than a little intense about my
        organization,but this combination of methods has never failed me!
